## **AuraOS: The Implementation-Ready Blueprint for a Zero-Cost AI Stack**

### **Step 1 — Clarify and Expand the Objective**

#### **Main Goal**
The primary objective of AuraOS is to design and build a **production-ready, fully-featured AI-powered system that operates at zero cost**. This is achieved by strategically integrating best-in-class free-tier AI APIs, open-source tools, and scalable infrastructure. This blueprint provides the architectural and implementation details to build prototypes and full-scale applications without incurring any financial expense for development, hosting, or moderate production usage.

#### **Core Benefits**
This architectural approach provides several key advantages:
*   **Cost-Efficiency:** Eliminates financial barriers to entry for building and deploying AI applications. The entire stack, from development to deployment, is free.
*   **Modularity:** The system is built upon **Modular Capability Provider (MCP)** servers, which are independent, single-purpose services. This allows for easy extension, replacement, and maintenance of individual components without affecting the entire system.
*   **Scalability:** While built on free tiers, the architecture is designed for growth. As usage scales, individual components can be seamlessly upgraded to paid tiers or swapped with more powerful alternatives without a full system redesign.
*   **Interoperability:** AuraOS is designed to connect disparate services—AI models, databases, and external APIs—into a cohesive whole, enabling complex, multi-step workflows.
*   **Superior Developer Experience:** By leveraging popular frameworks (like Next.js), managed databases (like Supabase), and serverless hosting (like Vercel), developers can focus on building features, not managing infrastructure.

#### **Success Criteria**
The successful implementation of this blueprint will be measured by:
1.  **Zero-Cost Compliance:** The entire default stack must run on perpetually free tiers, not just time-limited trials.
2.  **Seamless MCP Integration:** The core application must be able to discover, communicate with, and leverage MCP servers to perform tasks.
3.  **Rapid Prototyping:** A developer must be able to deploy a new AI-powered prototype using this stack in hours, not weeks.

### **Step 2 — Organize Free AI Tools, APIs, and Libraries**

To build a versatile AI system, we need a diverse set of models and tools. The following tables categorize the best free options available.

#### **Free AI Model Providers**

| Provider | Available Models (Free Tier) | Free Tier Limits | Key Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Groq** | Llama 3 8B/70B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemma 7B | Generous rate limits (e.g., ~30 req/min), subject to change. No hard monthly cap. | Blazing-fast chat, summarization, code generation, instruction following. Ideal for real-time interaction. |
| **Hugging Face** | Thousands of open-source models | **Inference API:** Free, but rate-limited and subject to "cold starts." | Niche tasks: sentiment analysis, translation, object detection, specialized text generation. |
| **Together AI** | Llama 3, Mixtral, Qwen, etc. | $25 in free credits upon signup. | Model comparison, fine-tuning experiments, access to a wide variety of open-source models. |
| **Cohere** | Command R, R+, Embed, Rerank | **Developer Plan:** 1000 reranks/month, 100k embed units/month. Rate limits on chat. | Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Rerank, multilingual embeddings. |
| **Google AI** | Gemini 1.5 Flash | **Free Tier:** 2 requests/minute, 2M tokens/minute, 50 requests/day. | Multimodal understanding (text, image, video), large context window processing. |

#### **Free AI Model Hosting Services**

These platforms help you deploy and run open-source models on managed infrastructure.

| Service | How it Works | Free Tier | Key Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Replicate** | Run public models via API or deploy your own. | Models go to sleep after inactivity. Pay-per-second of GPU time. Free for low traffic. | Running specialized models (e.g., Stable Diffusion for images, Suno for audio) without managing hardware. |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | Host models and apps on shared hardware. | Free CPU tier (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM). Can upgrade to paid GPUs. | Hosting Gradio/Streamlit demos, running small models continuously, hosting MCP servers. |
| **Modal** | Serverless GPU/CPU functions. | $30/month in free credits. | Ephemeral, parallelizable compute tasks like batch embedding generation or model fine-tuning. |

#### **Free Client-Side AI Libraries**

Run AI models directly in the user's browser to offload server computation and improve privacy.

| Library | Key Features | Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transformers.js** | Run 100s of Hugging Face models in the browser. | In-browser sentiment analysis, text generation, summarization, and embeddings. |
| **TensorFlow.js** | Full ML library for training and deploying models in JS. | Custom model inference, computer vision, predictive analytics in the browser. |
| **ONNX.js** | Run models in the Open Neural Network Exchange format. | High-performance inference for models exported from PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. |

---

### **Step 3 — Document Free MCP Servers**

**Modular Capability Providers (MCPs)** are lightweight, standalone servers that expose a specific tool or capability to the main AuraOS application over a simple API (e.g., REST). This makes the system extensible and robust.

#### **Official MCP Servers (Core Capabilities)**

| MCP Server | Installation / Setup | Capabilities | Example Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FileSystem** | `npm install @mcp/filesystem` | Read, write, list, and delete files in a sandboxed directory. | Creating notes, saving user data, managing workspace files. |
| **Git** | `npm install @mcp/git` | Clone, pull, push, commit, and inspect Git repositories. | Versioning user workspaces, integrating with GitHub/GitLab. |
| **SQLite** | `npm install @mcp/sqlite` | Execute SQL queries against a persistent SQLite database file. | Structured data storage, task management, simple relational data. |
| **Web Search** | `npm install @mcp/websearch` | Perform web searches using a free API (e.g., Tavily, SearxNG). | Answering user questions, fetching real-time information. |

#### **Community MCP Servers (Extended Capabilities)**

| MCP Server | Installation / Setup | Capabilities | Example Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Docker** | `docker run mcp/docker-server` | Run commands inside a Docker container, manage containers. | Code execution in a sandboxed environment, running external tools. |
| **GitHub** | `npm install @mcp/github` | Interact with the GitHub API: manage issues, PRs, repos. | Automating developer workflows, creating project management tools. |
| **AWS** | `npm install @mcp/aws` | Use the AWS SDK to interact with specific services (e.g., S3). | Managing cloud storage, triggering Lambda functions. |

#### **Recommended Default MCP Stack for AuraOS**

For a standard AuraOS deployment, the following MCPs provide a powerful and versatile foundation:
1.  **FileSystem MCP:** For basic state and file management.
2.  **SQLite MCP:** For structured, persistent data that can be queried.
3.  **Web Search MCP:** To ground the AI in real-time information.

These can be hosted for free as individual services on Hugging Face Spaces or within a single server instance on Railway/Fly.io.

---

### **Step 4 — Provide API & Database Integrations**

AuraOS becomes truly powerful when it can connect its internal capabilities with the outside world.

#### **Free Developer APIs**

| API | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JSONPlaceholder** | Fake REST API for testing and prototyping. | Debugging API integration logic. |
| **OpenWeatherMap** | Real-time weather data. | Building a weather assistant. |
| **NewsAPI** | Searchable news articles from various sources. | Creating a news summarization agent. |
| **REST Countries** | Get information about countries via a RESTful API. | Building a geography or travel planning tool. |

#### **Free Database Providers**

| Database | Model | Free Tier | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supabase** | PostgreSQL | 2 projects, 500MB DB, 1GB storage, 50k monthly auth users. | The primary database for user data, authentication, and vector storage (pgvector). |
| **PlanetScale** | MySQL | 1 database, 5GB storage, 1 billion row reads/mo. | Highly scalable relational data storage. |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | Document | 1 shared cluster, 512MB storage. | Flexible, schema-less data storage. |
| **Neon** | PostgreSQL | 1 project, 3GB storage, 1 vCPU, 10 branches. | Serverless Postgres with branching for dev workflows. |
| **Turso** | SQLite | 1 billion row reads/mo, 8GB total storage, 3 locations. | Globally replicated SQLite for low-latency reads. |

#### **Integration Patterns**
*   **AI-to-MCP-to-DB:** An AI agent receives a complex request (e.g., "Summarize my top 5 unread articles and save them").
    1.  **AI (Groq):** Analyzes the request and breaks it down into steps.
    2.  **MCP (Web Search):** Fetches the content of the articles.
    3.  **AI (Groq):** Summarizes the fetched content.
    4.  **DB (Supabase):** Stores the summaries in a user-specific table.
*   **API-to-MCP:** An external event triggers an action.
    1.  **API (GitHub Webhook):** A new issue is created.
    2.  **Backend (Vercel Function):** Receives the webhook.
    3.  **MCP (SQLite):** Logs the issue details in a local project management database.

---

### **Step 5 — Build Integration Examples**

Here are practical code snippets (in TypeScript) demonstrating how to combine these services.

#### **Example 1: AI Analysis -> SQLite Persistence**
This example uses Groq to categorize a user's note and the SQLite MCP to save it.

```typescript
// Main application logic (e.g., in a Next.js API route)
import { Groq } from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const SQLITE_MCP_URL = "http://localhost:3001/query"; // URL of your SQLite MCP

async function saveNote(noteContent: string) {
  // 1. Use AI to get metadata
  const chatCompletion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: `Analyze this note and return a JSON object with a "title" and a "category" (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Ideas"). Note: ${noteContent}`,
    }],
    model: "llama3-8b-8192",
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  });

  const metadata = JSON.parse(chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content || "{}");
  const { title, category } = metadata;

  // 2. Use MCP to persist to SQLite
  const query = `INSERT INTO notes (title, content, category) VALUES (?, ?, ?)`;
  const params = [title, noteContent, category];

  await fetch(SQLITE_MCP_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, params }),
  });

  console.log(`Note "${title}" saved to category "${category}".`);
}

// saveNote("Remember to buy milk and bread on the way home.");
```

#### **Example 2: Web Search MCP -> Supabase Vector Search (RAG)**
This shows a simple RAG pattern: search the web for context, then store it in Supabase for future use.

```typescript
// Main application logic
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { Groq } from "groq-sdk";

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL!, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!);
const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL = "http://localhost:3002/search";

async function researchAndStore(topic: string) {
  // 1. Use Web Search MCP to get context
  const searchResponse = await fetch(`${WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL}?query=${topic}`);
  const searchResults = await searchResponse.json(); // Assuming it returns { content: "..." }
  const context = searchResults.content;

  // 2. Use an AI API to get an embedding for the content
  // (Here we'd use Cohere/OpenAI, or a local model)
  // For simplicity, we'll mock this. In a real app, you'd call an embedding model.
  const { data: embedding } = await getEmbedding(context); // Fictional function

  // 3. Store the content and its embedding in Supabase
  const { error } = await supabase.from('documents').insert({
    content: context,
    embedding: embedding,
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error("Error saving to Supabase:", error);
  } else {
    console.log(`Research on "${topic}" stored successfully.`);
  }
}

async function getEmbedding(text: string): Promise<{ data: number[] }> {
    // In a real app, you would call an embedding model API here.
    // e.g., from Cohere, OpenAI, or a self-hosted sentence-transformer.
    console.log("Generating embedding for text...");
    // Mocked embedding
    return { data: Array.from({ length: 384 }, () => Math.random()) };
}

// researchAndStore("Latest advancements in serverless computing");
```

### **Step 6 — Define a Complete Free Stack**

Here is the recommended technology stack for AuraOS, presented in YAML format. Every component has a robust free tier suitable for production.

```yaml
# AuraOS: The Complete $0 Technology Stack

stack:
  frontend:
    framework: "Next.js"
    language: "TypeScript"
    styling: "Tailwind CSS"
    justification: "Best-in-class React framework with a powerful feature set (SSR, SSG, API routes) and seamless deployment."

  hosting:
    provider: "Vercel"
    plan: "Hobby (Free)"
    justification: "Generous free tier for serverless functions, automatic deployments from Git, global CDN, and zero-config setup for Next.js."

  backend:
    runtime: "Node.js (via Vercel Serverless Functions)"
    justification: "Leverages the Next.js API routes for a unified codebase. No need for a separate, always-on server, which saves cost."

  database:
    primary_db: "Supabase"
    service: "PostgreSQL"
    features: ["Authentication", "Storage", "Vector Embeddings (pgvector)"]
    justification: "All-in-one backend solution. Provides a robust Postgres database, user management, and vector support for RAG, all on a generous free plan."

  ai_ml:
    - provider: "Groq"
      use_case: "Primary LLM (Chat, Summarization, Function Calling)"
      justification: "Unmatched speed for real-time applications. Generous free rate limits."
    - provider: "Hugging Face"
      use_case: "Specialized Models (Inference API) & MCP Hosting (Spaces)"
      justification: "Access to thousands of open-source models for niche tasks. Spaces provide free hosting for our MCP servers."
    - provider: "Cohere"
      use_case: "Embeddings & Rerank API"
      justification: "High-quality embeddings and the powerful Rerank API are essential for building advanced RAG systems. The free tier is sufficient for initial development."

  mcp_servers:
    hosting: "Hugging Face Spaces (Free CPU Tier)"
    default_stack: ["FileSystem", "SQLite", "WebSearch"]

      plan: "Free tier with 1,000 requests/month."
    - name: "NewsAPI"
      use_case: "Structured News Retrieval"
      plan: "Free developer plan with 100 requests/day."
```

---

### **Step 7 — Provide Implementation Guide**

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and deploy AuraOS.

#### **1. Installation**

```bash
# 1. Clone your starter repository
git clone <your-aura-os-repo-url>
cd <your-aura-os-repo-url>

# 2. Install Next.js frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install MCP server dependencies (example for a Node.js-based MCP)
# (In a separate directory for each MCP)
# cd mcp/sqlite
# npm install
```

#### **2. Configuration (`.env.local`)**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your Next.js project. **Never commit this file to Git.**

```env
# AI Provider API Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
COHERE_API_KEY=...
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_...

# Supabase Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>

# MCP Server Endpoints (replace with your deployed Hugging Face Spaces URLs)
FILESYSTEM_MCP_URL=https://<your-hf-space>-mcp-filesystem.hf.space
SQLITE_MCP_URL=https://<your-hf-space>-mcp-sqlite.hf.space
WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL=https://<your-hf-space>-mcp-websearch.hf.space

# External APIs
TAVILY_API_KEY=...
```

#### **3. Developer Workflow**
1.  **Local Development:**
    *   Run the Next.js application locally: `npm run dev`.
    *   Run each MCP server locally in a separate terminal: `cd mcp/sqlite && npm run start`.
    *   Use the local MCP URLs in your `.env.local` file for testing.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for your UI components and utility functions using Jest and React Testing Library.
    *   Write integration tests that mock the `fetch` calls to AI providers and MCPs to ensure your application logic is correct without making real API calls.
3.  **Deployment:**
    *   Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab repository.
    *   Create a new project on Vercel and link it to your repository. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework and deploy it.
    *   Deploy your MCP servers to Hugging Face Spaces.
    *   Update the environment variables in your Vercel project settings with the production API keys and the deployed MCP URLs.

### **Step 8 — Summarize Costs & Limits**

This table outlines the free tier limits of the core services. Understanding these is key to managing the system at zero cost.

| Service | Free Tier Limit | What Happens When Exceeded? | Fallback Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vercel** | 100 GB-hours/month (Functions) | Execution pauses until the next billing cycle. | Optimize functions for speed; not a major concern for moderate traffic. |
| **Supabase** | 500MB Database, 1GB Storage | Service may be paused. Requires upgrade. | Regularly prune old data. Offload large files to other free storage. |
| **Groq** | Rate limited (e.g., 30 req/min) | Requests will be rejected (HTTP 429). | Implement exponential backoff. Failover to another provider like Together AI or Hugging Face. |
| **Cohere** | 100k embed units/mo, 1k reranks/mo | API calls will fail. | Cache embeddings. For Rerank, fall back to a simpler keyword-based ranking. |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | Shared CPU, sleeps on inactivity | Space becomes unresponsive until it wakes up. | For critical MCPs, use a cron job (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ping the space every hour to keep it active. |
| **Tavily API** | 1,000 requests/month | API calls will fail. | Cache search results. Failover to a self-hosted SearxNG instance. |

**Fallback Strategy:** The `AIManager` class (Step 9) should be designed to handle API failures gracefully. It can implement a provider rotation or failover logic. For example, if a Groq request fails, it can automatically retry the request with a model on Together AI.

---

### **Step 9 — Deliver Integration Blueprint**

This section provides a class-based TypeScript blueprint for integrating all services cleanly.

#### **1. Centralized AI Client (`services/ai/AIManager.ts`)**

```typescript
import { Groq } from "groq-sdk";
// Import other AI SDKs as needed

type AIProvider = "groq" | "cohere" | "huggingface";

class AIManager {
  private groq: Groq;
  // Add other clients here

  constructor() {
    this.groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
  }

  async getChatCompletion(prompt: string, provider: AIProvider = "groq") {
    try {
      if (provider === "groq") {
        const completion = await this.groq.chat.completions.create({
          messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
          model: "llama3-8b-8192",
        });
        return completion.choices[0].message.content;
      }
      // Add logic for other providers here
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error with ${provider}:`, error);
      // Implement failover logic, e.g., try another provider
      return "Error: Could not get completion.";
    }
  }

  // Add methods for embeddings, reranking, etc.
}

export const aiManager = new AIManager();
```

#### **2. MCP Manager (`services/mcp/MCPManager.ts`)**

```typescript
type MCP = "sqlite" | "filesystem" | "websearch";

class MCPManager {
  private getUrl(mcp: MCP): string {
    const urls = {
      sqlite: process.env.SQLITE_MCP_URL!,
      filesystem: process.env.FILESYSTEM_MCP_URL!,
      websearch: process.env.WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL!,
    };
    return urls[mcp];
  }

  async sqliteQuery(query: string, params: any[]) {
    const res = await fetch(`${this.getUrl("sqlite")}/query`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query, params }),
    });
    return res.json();
  }

  async webSearch(query: string) {
    const res = await fetch(`${this.getUrl("websearch")}/search?query=${query}`);
    return res.json();
  }

  // Add methods for other MCPs
}

export const mcpManager = new MCPManager();
```

#### **3. Workspace Creation Logic (`pages/api/workspace/create.ts`)**

This API route shows how to combine these managers to perform a complex task.

```typescript
// pages/api/workspace/create.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { aiManager } from "@/services/ai/AIManager";
import { mcpManager } from "@/services/mcp/MCPManager";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { taskDescription } = req.body;

  // 1. Use AI to generate a plan
  const planPrompt = `Create a step-by-step plan to accomplish this task: ${taskDescription}. The plan should involve using a SQLite database and a filesystem.`;
  const plan = await aiManager.getChatCompletion(planPrompt);

  // 2. Use MCPs to set up the workspace
  // Create a table in the SQLite DB
  const tableQuery = `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, description TEXT, status TEXT);`;
  await mcpManager.sqliteQuery(tableQuery, []);

  // Add the first task
  const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO tasks (description, status) VALUES (?, 'pending');`;
  await mcpManager.sqliteQuery(insertQuery, [taskDescription]);

  // (Example) Create a file in the filesystem
  // await mcpManager.writeFile('plan.md', plan);

  res.status(200).json({ message: "Workspace created successfully!", plan });
}
```

#### **4. Deployment Configuration (`vercel.json`)**

While Vercel offers zero-config deployments, you can add a `vercel.json` for advanced configuration, such as custom headers or rewrites. For this stack, it's often not needed initially.

---

### **Step 10 — Conclude with Key Takeaways**

This blueprint details the architecture for **AuraOS, a powerful AI system that can be built, deployed, and run for free**. By leveraging a modular, API-driven design, it achieves a rare combination of cost-efficiency, power, and scalability.

*   **100% Free Operation:** For hobbyists, startups, and researchers, this stack completely removes the financial barrier to building production-grade AI tools. The system is designed to operate comfortably within the generous free tiers of modern cloud and AI providers.
*   **Rapid Implementation:** A developer can take this blueprint and deploy a working prototype in a single weekend. The use of managed services and high-level frameworks minimizes boilerplate and infrastructure management.
*   **High Maintainability & Extensibility:** The MCP architecture ensures that the system is easy to maintain and extend. Adding a new capability is as simple as deploying a new MCP and adding a corresponding method to the `MCPManager`. Swapping out an AI provider requires minimal code changes in the `AIManager`.
*   **Path to Scale:** When an application outgrows the free tiers, this architecture provides a clear and gradual path to scaling. A single component (e.g., the database) can be upgraded to a paid plan on Supabase, or a high-traffic AI endpoint can be moved to a dedicated paid provider, all without disrupting the rest of the system.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Build the Core:** Start by implementing the `AIManager` and `MCPManager` classes.
2.  **Deploy the MCPs:** Create and deploy the default MCP stack (SQLite, FileSystem, WebSearch) on Hugging Face Spaces.
3.  **Develop the Frontend:** Build the user interface on Next.js and connect it to your backend API routes.
4.  **Iterate:** Continuously add new capabilities by integrating more APIs and developing new MCPs.
