# AuraOS IDE Agent — Full System Gap Report
Generated: 2025-09-21T21:34:00Z

Section 1: Missing Pages
- [ ] Synapse NotesList → List/search user notes (Firestore) → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Synapse NoteEditor → TipTap editor + autosave + attachments → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Vault Browser → File tree/list, upload, metadata → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Vault FilePreview → PDF/Image preview → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Chronos Calendar → Month/Week view + create event → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Chronos Notifications → Local/push settings UI → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Atlas TripEditor → Create trip, add segments → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Atlas TripTimeline → Itinerary view → ❌ Missing
- [ ] Core Settings Panel → Theme/locale/timezone bindings across apps → 🟡 Partially implemented (client/src/pages/settings.tsx)
- [ ] Core Auth Screens → Login/Profile wired to Firebase → 🟡 Partially implemented (apps/core placeholders only)

Section 2: Apps/Agents Coverage
- Core → Status: 🟡 Partially implemented
  Gaps: Firebase Auth wiring (apps/core/src/services/auth.ts placeholder), global settings consumption by other apps, error boundary.
  MVP next steps: Implement Firebase Auth in apps/core, add global ErrorBoundary, ensure packages/common settings are read in server and client pages.
- Synapse → Status: ❌ Missing
  Gaps: No apps/synapse directory; no Firestore CRUD; summarize endpoint missing.
  MVP next steps: scaffold apps/synapse with pages/NotesList.tsx and NoteEditor.tsx; add apps/synapse/src/services/notesService.ts using Firestore; implement POST /api/synapse/summarize in server/routes.ts calling services/synapseSummarize.
- Vault → Status: ❌ Missing
  Gaps: No apps/vault; no Storage upload; no metadata collection; no preview component.
  MVP next steps: scaffold apps/vault with pages/Browser.tsx and components/FilePreview.tsx; implement Firebase Storage client; create Firestore collection vault_files; secure rules in infra/firestore.rules.
- Chronos → Status: ❌ Missing
  Gaps: No apps/chronos; no create-event API; no notifications wiring.
  MVP next steps: scaffold apps/chronos with pages/Calendar.tsx; implement POST /api/chronos/create-event and /api/chronos/from-action (services/chronosCreateEvent → server/routes.ts); add notifications via Service Worker.
- Atlas → Status: ❌ Missing
  Gaps: No apps/atlas; no trip model; no cross-app orchestration.
  MVP next steps: scaffold apps/atlas with pages/TripEditor.tsx and TripTimeline.tsx; integrate Vault upload; call Chronos create-event; call Synapse summarize.

Section 3: MCP Integrations
- Expected MCPs: GitHub MCP, Firebase MCP, Google AI Studio MCP, Prometheus MCP
- Installed: Custom MCP server present (server/mcp-server.ts) with tools like web_scraper, data_analyzer, text_processor, file_operations, and cursor CLI helpers.
- Missing Config: .cursor/mcp.json → ❌ Missing
- Actions:
  - Create .cursor/mcp.json with MCP endpoints and credentials placeholders.
  - Map server/mcp-server.ts tools to MCP registry entries for discoverability.
  Example .cursor/mcp.json snippet:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "github": { "command": "gh", "args": ["api"], "enabled": true },
      "firebase": { "command": "firebase", "args": ["--help"], "enabled": true },
      "google_ai_studio": { "command": "genai", "args": ["models"], "enabled": true },
      "prometheus": { "command": "curl", "args": ["http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets"], "enabled": true }
    }
  }

Section 4: AI Tools Integration
- Summarization API → 🟡 Partial
  Findings: services/synapseSummarize is a README placeholder; no /api/synapse/summarize route in server/routes.ts.
  Action: Add POST /api/synapse/summarize in server/routes.ts; implementation uses OPENAI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY from env.
- Voice Recognition API → ❌ Missing
  Findings: server/multi-modal-ai.ts mentions TTS/voice-cloning; no ASR.
  Action: Client: integrate Web Speech API or upload to Whisper via a new endpoint POST /api/voice/transcribe.
- Scheduling/AI Calendar → ❌ Missing
  Findings: services/chronosCreateEvent is a placeholder; no routes.
  Action: Add POST /api/chronos/create-event and /api/chronos/from-action in server/routes.ts; persist to Firestore (chronos_events) and schedule notifications (Service Worker).

Section 5: Debugging & Test Coverage
- Frameworks present: Jest configured; Cypress present with cypress/e2e/smart-notes.cy.ts; multiple integration scripts in root (test-*.cjs).
- Current coverage: N/A (no coverage report published in CI)
- Gaps: No unit tests for packages/common/src/stores/settings.ts; no tests for apps/core auth service; no E2E for agent apps.
- Suggested tests:
  - packages/common/src/stores/settings.ts → settings.store.test.ts
  - apps/core/src/services/auth.ts → auth.service.test.ts (mock Firebase)
  - server/routes.ts → synapse summarize handler test, chronos create-event test
  - E2E: client pages for /ai-travel-agency (Atlas-like), /mcp-tools, /settings

Section 6: Recommendations
- Sprint priorities:
  1) Core – Auth wiring, global settings consumption, error boundary
  2) Synapse – Scaffold MVP, Firestore CRUD, summarize endpoint
  3) Vault – Upload/metadata/preview + rules
  4) Chronos – Calendar UI + create-event + notifications
  5) Atlas – Trip editor + cross-app integrations
- MCP + AI integrations list: GitHub MCP, Firebase MCP, Google AI Studio MCP, Prometheus MCP; Summarization API; Voice recognition; Calendar AI
- Missing pages backlog:
  - Synapse: NotesList, NoteEditor
  - Vault: Browser, FilePreview
  - Chronos: Calendar, Notifications
  - Atlas: TripEditor, TripTimeline
  - Core: Settings polish, Auth wiring UI
Section 1: Missing Pages
- Synapse Dashboard & Flows → Data synchronization & AI orchestration across apps → ❌ Missing
- Vault Encryption & Key Management UI → Encryption controls, key lifecycle UI → 🟡 Partially implemented
- Chronos Travel & Alarms UI → Event scheduling, timezone handling UI → ❌ Missing
- Atlas Cross-App Orchestrator → Global scheduling across Core/Synapse/Vault/Chronos → ❌ Missing
- Core Navigation & State UI → Foundation navigation, session state persistence → 🟡 Partially implemented

Section 2: Apps/Agents Coverage
- Core → Status: 🟡 Partially implemented; MVP gaps: advanced navigation flows, session persistence, error handling
- Synapse → Status: ❌ Missing; MVP gaps: scaffold Synapse module, data sync surface, basic API surface
- Vault → Status: 🟡 Partially implemented; MVP gaps: encryption wrappers, key management UI, audit trails
- Chronos → Status: ❌ Missing; MVP gaps: event engine skeleton, recurring events logic, timezone handling
- Atlas → Status: ❌ Missing; MVP gaps: cross-app orchestration scaffold, triggers & actions registry

Section 3: MCP Integrations
- Expected MCPs: GitHub MCP, Firebase MCP, Google AI Studio MCP, Prometheus MCP
- Installed vs Missing: All major MCPs Missing
- File paths/config checks: Recommend adding .cursor/mcp.json with MCP registry and per-MCP configuration blocks

Section 4: AI Tools Integration
- Summarization API → Status: 🟡 Partially implemented; notes: generic APIs wired, no end-to-end flow
- NLP / AI Prompt Engine → Status: 🟡 Partial; notes: OpenAI/GenAI libs present, integration surface limited
- Voice Recognition API → Status: ❌ Missing
- Scheduling AI Calendar Integration → Status: ❌ Missing

Section 5: Debugging & Test Coverage
- Current test % → N/A (No consolidated coverage report yet)
- Gaps → Core/Others lack targeted unit/integration tests
- Suggested test files:
  - Core: /src/hooks/use-auth.ts, /src/lib/api.ts, /src/store/user-slice.ts → *.test.ts
  - Synapse: /src/apps/synapse/... → unit/integration tests
  - Vault: /src/apps/vault/... → encryption/decryption tests
  - Chronos: /src/apps/chronos/lib/event-logic.ts → event logic tests
  - Atlas: /src/apps/atlas/... → orchestration tests

Section 6: Recommendations
- Sprint priorities (in order):
  1) Core – estabilize foundational auth/state/navigation
  2) Synapse – scaffold MVP, data sync surface
  3) Vault – encryption, secure storage UX
  4) Chronos – events/alarms/timezone core
  5) Atlas – cross-app orchestration scaffold
